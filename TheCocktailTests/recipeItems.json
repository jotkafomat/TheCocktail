Put the gin in a sterilised jar, add the cinnamon and star anise, seal and leave to steep for up to 24 hours. Start tasting every hour or so after three or four hours, to check how much stronger you want the spices to show through – you need only a very gentle infusion here. Fine-strain to remove any tiny, loose bits of spice, jar again and seal.</p> <p>To make the miso syrup, put the white miso in a bowl with the caster sugar, add the boiling water and whisk until the sugar dissolves.</p> <p>To build the drink, put the measures of spiced gin, syrup, lemon juice, sake and curaçao in a shaker, add the egg white (or aqua faba) and shake hard without ice – this will help create a silky foam. Add ice, shake again, then strain into a wine glass or coupette (chilled, if you like, and we do), and serve.</p> <p>• Cameron Malik Flynn, <a href=\"https://baolondon.com/restaurant/cafe-bao/\">Cafe Bao</a>, London N1</p>",
